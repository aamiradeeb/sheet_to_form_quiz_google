In this video, we will use 2 Google apps, which are Google Sheets and Google Forms, to create a usable quiz from scratch

The Spreadsheet.
Step 1.  Create a new Google Sheets document.
Step 2.  OK, our target is to make column A the Question, and Column B the correct Answer.  Columns C, D, E, and F will be incorrect distractor Choices.   

Fill that formula down in Column C, C2 through C50.  Columns C, D, E, and F will have distractors at this point, with no duplicates per row.  
OK, the source for the quiz is ready.  When the app script runs, it will shuffle the 5 choices and then write to the quiz in Forms.  
We have 1 more step to do: add our app script to the sheets document and run it.  The app script creates the Google form, and writes the 50 questions out to it.

The App Script.
Step 1.  In our Google sheets doc, go to Tools and Script editor.  Replace the default content with the attached script.  
There are 2 functions: popForm and shuffleEachRow.  Function shuffleEachRow is not used directly, it is just a sub-function for  popForm.
Click Save.  
Give this project a nice name of some sort, like “Capitals”.
Run the function popForm.  First time through, there will be a string of permission boxes to navigate.  Just agree to everything until you get through Allow.  The script starts to run --  reading the rows from Sheet1, and writing them out to our Form.  This process takes about 1 minute to complete the 50 rows.
Run the Form.
Open the form.  Eureka!  It is done.  Preview the quiz to make sure it fits our needs, and share it out when ready.
Thanks for your attention.
